React router dom in file App (global)
exp:
    <Router>
      <div className='nav-'>
        <Nav/>
        <Switch>
            <Route path="/news">
              news
            </Route>
            <Route path="/about">
              about
            </Route>
            <Route path="/contact">
              contact
            </Route>
            <Route path="/">
              home
            </Route>
          </Switch>
      </div>
    </Router>

Then NavLink in the Nav file to prevent reloading the whole webpage when switching tabs
NavLink takes care of active nav section for us, so we don't need to className="active" anymore

            <Route path="*">
              404 not found
            </Route>
This is for the case when no route is found

                    <div className="content-left col-12 d-none col-sm-7 d-sm-block">
                        <div className='brand'>
                            Duc
                        </div>
                        <div className='detail'>
                            Learn everything...
                        </div>
                    </div>
Means that col-7 and d-block only applicable for screen with small size and UP, anything below that is col-12 and d-none
